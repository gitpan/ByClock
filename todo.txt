To do with Schedule::ByClock

All future development of ByClock is 'user driven'. I.e. if I
get requests, I will consider enhancements. Don't hesitate to
send me e-mail. I will listen to you. :-)


+ Today, the ByClock class can return control on given seconds
  in the minute. I think it would make sense if it could also
  return control at given minutes vithin the hour.
  This could easily be implemented. The values stored, or used
  in an ad hoc call, are the same; 0-59.
  It would probably not make sense to call ByClock to sleep for
  about one hour, but if there is a need to wake up at for
  instance 12, 33 and 57 every hour, then it might make sense.
  Anyway, I don't have the need for it myself, so if you want
  it, let me know!
  
  I don't think it would make sense to implement a method to
  wake up on given hour of the day. I don't see why this would
  be used, but if I get requests for it, I will seriously
  consider it.
